Cry, a story written by make-a-wish-24067 and monoessece-24067.

Once I went to a restaurant, the song they played was like, "You are stoopid, bum dadum ba dum dadum." That day, I was heart broken, for ten years, I cried. I cried more than an 
river, I cried a puddle. After I cried for ten years, I had a decision not to be a crybaby and cry over this silly stuff. As I went to the restaurant again, it played Twice, my 
favorite group. But the song was 'Cry for Me', and so I did. For 20 years, I cried in my house, lonely and ever. My parents even moved out, because they feared that the house 
would flood from a puddle. 
After 30 years, I was 30 years old. I cried since birth. My eyes were swollen and snot kept running down my nose. Then, for another 30 years, I stayed at home, fearing people 
would laugh at my smexy nose and eyes. After the 30 years, I was 60. Old man I was, very old. I once again entered the shop and they were playing Shrek. Wow! How much I loved that 
movie. I watched it many times until it was my death. Death comes before me. Water surrounding me. I die a peaceful snotty death.
